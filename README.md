# typings

Modern typing test inspired by [typings.gg](https://typings.gg).

## Compatibility

Typings is made with Vue.js and latest browser features (e.g. ES, LocalStorage, fetch API, async/await, etc.), which compats only up-to-date browsers.

I test it under:

- Google Chrome 80
- Microsoft Edge 44
- Mozilla Firefox 74

## Development

```shell
yarn install
yarn serve
```

## Deployment

- `docs` is for GitHub Pages publishing. Stable version will be built and placed to here.

```shell
yarn build
```

## Texts

Only English is supported. I may add other languages in the future.

The English texts are based on [briano1905/typings](https://github.com/briano1905/typings/blob/master/texts/random.json), but I added some more random words according to my hobby.

## Themes

Theme is implemented with CSS variables and saved with JavaScript LocalStorage API.
